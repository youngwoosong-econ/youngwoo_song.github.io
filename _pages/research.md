**The Effect of the Language of Instruction Policy on Educational Attainment: Evidence from African Countries**
  - _Is the level of educational attainment hindered when students are taught in a language which they are less familiar with?_
  - [Abstract] In Sub-Saharan Africa, more than a fifth of children and a third of youth are out of school. This study focuses on the unique linguistic aspect of Africa as the source of low educational achievement. Due to the discrepancy between the official language and the mother-tongue language, there are many countries in Africa where the medium of instruction is not their home language. Using a novel dataset containing the language of instruction policy for 54 African countries from 1970 to 2017, I find that the countries in which students are taught under transitional models and international languages have a significantly lower level of educational attainment than those in which students are taught in their native languages. I also find an additional year of mother-tongue instruction in the first four years in primary education increases average school life expectancy by around 0.25 years. These results suggest that the implementation of supplementary mother-tongue programs in African countries with limited mother-tongue instruction can help underachieved students.
